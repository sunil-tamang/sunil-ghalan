  description: "Expedition to Everest (May/2025), led by Rodrigo Xavier, CEO of V8.Tech, with the bold objective of reaching the top of the world in under 30 days, challenging physical and mental limits in one of the most intense journeys ever undertaken by a Brazilian. After a month of pre-acclimatization in a hypoxic chamber and meticulously planned logistics, Rodrigo faced extreme temperatures, death zones, aerial rescues, and his own human vulnerability at over 8,000 meters of altitude. His journey took place on the greatest symbol of world mountaineering, set against a backdrop of fear, overcoming, and love for life and family."
